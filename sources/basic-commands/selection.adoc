== Introduction

Some FAWE commands require a region selection to work. This command allows you to amend and or remove your current selection. The `selection-type` argument is used to alter the region selected, whether it be to enlarge the selection or to change its shape.

*Usage:*
`//sel [selection-type]`

*Aliases:*
`[ deselect, desel, /; ]`

*Permission:*
`worldedit.analysis.sel`

== Selection-Types

=== Cuboid

This most commonly used selection and is the *default type*. The cuboid selection requires two points to be defined.

=== Extend

This is an advanced version of the cuboid selection. After the first two points are defined, the selection can be expanded by defining even more point. The final selection will remain a cuboid.

=== Poly

With this type you get a geometrical selection with a free polygonal border. The height of the polygon is determined by the Y-coordinate of the highest and lowest positions. An infinite amount of points can be defined. The border connects all corners and is sorted by an incrementing number.

=== Ellipsoid

In this selection, your region is an ellipsoid. The `position 1` argument defines the mid-point, the `position 2` argument is used to alter the length, width and height of the ellipsoid.

=== Sphere

This selection yields a spherical region. The `position 1` argument defines the mid-point and the `position 2` argument defines the radius.

=== Cyl

The selection type produces a cylindrical selection. The `position 1` argument defines the mid-point of the cylinder and the `position 2` argument define both the radius and the depth (height) of the cylinder.

=== Polyhedron

Alias: "Convex" and "Hull"

With this selection type you get anfree polygonal selection. In different of the `poly` selection, the height isn't determined.

=== Fuzzy

Alias: "Magic"

This selection type select all blocks from the same material of your marked block. So if you click at an `orange_wool` block all `orange_wool` blocks in the next near without one block distance are selected.

* With a left-click you choice the first block / the first material. With the following right-click you add it to your choice.
* It check the neighbor blocks with an path-finder (top, bottom, side-blocks for each block separately) so it doesn't need a radius argument.

== Selection commands

=== Wand

Positions are defined in various ways. One of these ways is through the use of a tool-item, by default this is the ubiquitous vanilla `wooden_axe`. Left-clicking a block with the item defines the primary position (aka "pos1") and right click defines the secondary position (aka "pos2").

The FAWE tool-item is obtained through the `//wand` command.

*Usage:*
`//wand`

*Permission:*
`worldedit.wand`

=== Pos

A different way to define the selection corner is through the use of the `//pos` commands. If no parameters are specified, the position will be set to the coordinate your standing in (picture). Alternatively, you can define the coordinates explicitly with the `coordinates` argument. The argument follows this syntax: `<X>,<Y>,<Z>`. You use one value for all three coordinates.

*Usage:*
`//pos1 [coordinates]` and `//pos2 [coordinates]`

*Aliases:*
`//1` and `//2`

*Permission:*
`worldedit.selection.pos`

*Visual Example:*

=== Hpos

This is the third way to define the selection corner. This will select the next solid block in your https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/File:HUD_example.png[crosshair].

*Usage:*
`//hpos1` and `//hpos2`

*Permission:*
`worldedit.selection.hpos`

*Visual Example:*

=== Chunk

This command changes your selection type to the `cuboid` selection type and selects all the blocks in a given https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk[chunk]. By default, the chunk you are currently located in will be selected.

Alternatively, the target chunk can be explicitly defined by either:

* Passing a block's `x` and `z` coordinate
* Passing valid https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk#Finding_chunk_edges[chunk coordinates] alongside the `-c` flag.

The `-s` flag allows you to re-select all chunks of your current selection.

*Usage:*

Primary:

`//chunk`

Secondary:

* `//chunk <x,z block coordinates>`
* `//chunk <x,z chunk coordinates> -c`
* `//chunk -s`

*Permission:*
`worldedit.selection.chunk`

=== Shift

With the shift command you can shift your selection. In different of the `//move` command you shift not any blocks (see picture).

* To define your target direction, look to to the direction or use the `direction` argument. The list of valid direction arguments you find https://wiki.intellectualsites.comhttps://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit-Documentation/wiki/Commands-new#direction-argument[here].
* With the `amount` argument your specify the amount of block which are moved in the direction.
* An negative `amount` will invert your shift direction.

*Usage:*

Primary:

`//shift <amount>`

Secondary:

`//shift <amount> <direction>`

*Visual Example:*

image::https://i.imgur.com/3ZvSx8F.png[shift.png]

=== Inset

With this command your decrease your selection with the same amount by all sides (see picture).

Alternatively, the decrease can be explicitly defined by:

* The `amount` of block for the horizontal line alongside the `-h` flag
* The `amount` of block for the vertical line alongside the `-v` flag

*Usage:*

Primary:

`//inset <amount>`

Secondary:

* `//inset <amount> -h`
* `//inset <amount> -v`

*Visual Example:*

image::https://i.imgur.com/sw0uQdo.png[inset.png]

=== Outset

With this command your increase your selection with the same amount by all sides (see picture).

Alternatively, the increase can be explicitly defined by:

* The `amount` of block for the horizontal line alongside the `-h` flag
* The `amount` of block for the vertical line alongside the `-v` flag

*Usage:*

Primary:

`//outset <amount>`

Secondary:

* `//outset <amount> -h`
* `//outset <amount> -v`

*Visual Example:*

image::https://i.imgur.com/tC0LhXY.png[outset.png]

=== Contract

Comparable to the `inset` command your can decrease your selection - but at here for a specify direction. So the decrease will only execute for one or two sides (see picture).

* To define your target direction, look to to the direction or use the `direction` argument. The list of valid direction arguments you find https://wiki.intellectualsites.comhttps://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit-Documentation/wiki/Commands-new#direction-argument[here].
* With the `amount` argument your specify the amount of block which are decreased.
* An second `reverse-amount` will decrease the selection for the inverted side.

*Usage:*

Primary:

`//contract <amount>`

Secondary:

* `//contract <amount> <direction>`
* `//contract <amount> <reverse-amount>`
* `//contract <amount> <reverse-amount> <direction>`

*Visual Example:*

image::https://i.imgur.com/ZEB4ocp.png[contract.png]

=== Expand

Comparable to the `outset` command your can increase your selection - but at here for a specify direction. So the increase will only execute for one or two sides (see picture).

* To define your target direction, look to to the direction or use the `direction` argument. The list of valid direction arguments you find https://wiki.intellectualsites.comhttps://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit-Documentation/wiki/Commands-new#direction-argument[here].
* With the `amount` argument your specify the amount of block which are increased.
* An second `reverse-amount` will decrease the selection for the inverted side.
* With the shortest specification of the expand command `vert`, the selection will increase for all blocks in the vertical line (level 0 - 256).

*Usage:*

Primary:

`//expand <amount>`

Secondary:

* `//expand <amount> <direction>`
* `//expand <amount> <reverse-amount>`
* `//expand <amount> <reverse-amount> <direction>`
* `//expand vert`

*Visual Example:*
