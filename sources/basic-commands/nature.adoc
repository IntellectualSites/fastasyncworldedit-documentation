== Drain

This command removes water from a spherical region (picture 1).

* You must choose a location which contains water to execute this command. This command will drain water from a sphere around you with the defined `radius` with the centre being your current position.
* Note that the command delete only the water in one resource: if you have another pool inside your radius, it will be ignored (picture 2).
* With the argument `-w` you can change the water-logged https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Block_states[block state] state of blocks to "false". For example, wooden slabs will be "dried" and no longer be water-logged (picture 3).
* With the argument `-p` all of plants which are in the water will be removed (picture 4).
